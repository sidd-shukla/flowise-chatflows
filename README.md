# Flowise Chatflows

This repository contains exported **Flowise** chatflow JSON files. These exports capture the structure of AI chatbots and agents I have built using [Flowise Cloud](https://cloud.flowiseai.com).

By importing these JSON files into Flowise, you can replicate the exact flows (nodes, prompts, chains, agents) and customize them for your own projects.

## âœ¨ Tips
- You need a valid **OpenAI API key** (or other model provider key) set up in Flowise under **Credentials**.
- After importing, always check the **LLM node settings** and reselect your credential, since API keys are not exported for security reasons.
- You can duplicate flows in Flowise to create new versions and export them back here for version control.
